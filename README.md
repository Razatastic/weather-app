# weather-app
A clean and simple weather app that displays the weather given your location.

Built with Create React App, React Hooks, Grommet, Surge and the OpenWeatherMap API.

I am on a limited-call plan for the weather API I'm utilizing. If you're greeted by this page, then you know why! ðŸ˜¢
